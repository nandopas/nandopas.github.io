                <h4>Electric Car</h4>
                <p> - Building the first Electric Vehicle for Columbia University's Motorsports team</p>

                    <p>
                        - Responsible for the design and integration of the drivetrain, 
                        design of the cooling system, and machining of all components.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        - I learned a great amount about designing components to strike a balance between performance 
                        (material weight vs load bearing capabilities), machinability, and reducing waste of material 
                        during machining processes. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        - Additionally, I had to consider fitting the drivetrain of an electric 
                        vehicle into a chassis primarily designed for an internal combustion engine, all while communicating 
                        with other team members to gain an idea of my design limitations in conjunction with their contributions
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        - A huge shout out to the rest of my senior design team for their immense effort, the countless late nights, great learning experience, and bringing me food to the machine shop!

                <h4>Load Cell Electric Skateboard</h4>
                <p> - Electrical prototype for a skateboard driven by changes in user weight distribution</p>

                        - The idea is to create a skateboard that will accelerate itself based on a user's weight distribution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        - I looked into how the WiiFit board was designed and discovered the weight sensing element is found in everyday electronic scales: load cells. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        - I began taking apart some electronic scales to grab their load cells and wired them up to create a wheatstone bridge. I connected the output to a differential gain amplifier to increase the output signal and verified the results with a multimeter. A change in pressure resulted in a demonstrable change in voltage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Created prototype driven by brushless DC motor fueled by LiPo battery. Load cell weight inputted into Arduino which determines motor speed based on weight distribution and foot placement.

                    <p>
                        - Implemented websockets (Rails ActionCable) to provide real time user group chats in app

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - I implemented this by using Spotify's Web API to get data from albums based on user search queries. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        - What is returned by the API request is compared to what is in SpotVote's database. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - If it is not in SpotVote's database, the album info is added to the database. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - If an album is already in the database, saving the Spotify API query does not occur and instead the album is pulled from the database.

                    <p>
                        - Some optimizations for this could involve caching search query strings and mapping them to certain results to avoid so many database requests.

                    <p>
                        - Subbit is built off a Ruby on Rails backend API supported by PostgreSQL

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Subbit creates pages of user-generated and user-ranked posts about events going on near subway stops, 
                        essentially creating a social network of off-the-radar events in NYC.

                    <p>
                        - I was inspired after attending an underground tech meetup and wanted to create an app 
                        that would help these kind of events be discovered. 
                        I also want to find for myself and other users some pop-up events that don't 
                        appear at the top of results on sites such as Yelp or Google maps.

                        - Machine Design Final Project: Design, manufacturing, and analysis of air compressor valve. I worked with 2 other team mates to design and build a valve to drive an air compressor in the mechanical engineering laboratory.

                        - I was primarily responsible for ensuring all component designs were machinable and machining all components.

                    <p>
                        - Due to putting manufacturability first in the design process, our team produced the lowest cost valve in our class, coming in at $26 total. We were able to cut costs with a simple design, reducing material waste by matching raw material dimensions as much as possible, and retrofitting our design to the test mount available in the lab set up

                        - This was a great opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and learn about advanced circuit design while combining engineering with my passion for music. I learned how to properly use lab equipment such as oscilliscopes to verify the behavior of different sounds modules.

                    <p>
                        - Throughout the revival process, we found many potentiometers to be shorting due to dust and rusting. The biggest challenge was sourcing a ramping power supply that would ramp up to the appropriate voltage. A level power supply supplied too much voltage instantaneously, causing a large spike in current, in turn, blowing out protective fuses.

                    <p>
                        - An interesting problem I found in the design involved lights in the sequencer connected in series with its corresponding circuit. So whenever a light was out, the corresponding step in the sequencer would not receive any voltage, thus rendering the step useless.

                        - I'd like to thank Pr. David Vallancourt for providing the opportunity and the rest of the team for tackling this project!

                <h4>Manufacturing Oven</h4>
                <p> - Design and build of manufacturing oven for Polymer Exploration Group</p>

                <div class="card-hover-text">
                    <p>
                        - During my internship at Polymer Exploration Group (PEG), I was tasked with increasing the manufacturing capabilities of the polymer product. I created a roll-to-roll manufacuring oven that allowed PEG to increase manufacturing output by 1200%.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        - The materials used were common HVAC equipment such as ducting and insulation because of their relative low cost, ease of construction, and ability to hold heat.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        - To maintain heat within the oven, I found heating tape and thermocouples and controllers in our warehouse to transfer heat into the space of the oven and create a feedback loop through the controller which would control the amount of heat transmitted by the tape to maintain a setpoint temperature.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        - A challenge I ran into was evenly distributing the temperature throughout the space as heat tended to build up at the ends of the oven. To solve this, I added a relief duct with a fan to allow for air circulation while still containing heat in the space so energy would not be wasted by venting out excess heat.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        - I'd like to thank Dr. Wei Zhang for providing me this great learning opportunity at PEG!
