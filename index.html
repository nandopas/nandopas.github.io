                      <p class="card-text">Started working on this project after graduation. The idea is to create a skateboard that will accelerate itself based on a user's weight distribution.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">I looked into how the WiiFit board was designed and discovered the weight sensing element is found in everyday electronic scales: load cells. I began taking apart some electronic scales to grab their load cells and wired them up to create a wheatstone bridge. I connected the output to a differential gain amplifier to increase the output signal and verified the results with a multimeter. A change in pressure resulted in a demonstrable change in voltage.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">My future plans with this project is to connect the output to an arduino and drive a simple DC motor as a proof of concept. Once this is done, the true challenge will come in creating a feedback control system to appropriately ramp up the velocity based on a change in pressure.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">I put this project on hold currently due to apartment space limitations and focus a bit on Subbit. Planning on hopping back on this in April.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">Due to putting manufacturability first in the design process, our team produced the lowest cost valve in our class, coming in at $26 total.

                      <p class="card-text">This was a great opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and learn about advanced circuit design while combining engineering with my passion for music. I learned how to properly use lab equipment such as oscilliscopes to verify the behavior of different sounds modules.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">Throughout the revival process, we found many potentiometers to be shorting due to dust and rusting. The biggest challenge was sourcing a ramping power supply that would ramp up to the appropriate voltage. A level power supply supplied too much voltage instantaneously, causing a large spike in current, in turn, blowing out protective fuses.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">An interesting problem I found in the design involved lights in the sequencer connected in series with its corresponding circuit. So whenever a light was out, the corresponding step in the sequencer would not receive any voltage, thus rendering the step useless.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">During my internship at Polymer Exploration Group (PEG), I was tasked with increasing the manufacturing capabilities of the polymer product. I created a roll-to-roll manufacuring oven that allowed PEG to increase manufacturing output by 1200%.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">The materials used were common HVAC equipment such as ducting and insulation because of their relative low cost, ease of construction, and ability to hold heat.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">To maintain heat within the oven, I found heating tape and thermocouples and controllers in our warehouse to transfer heat into the space of the oven and create a feedback loop through the controller which would control the amount of heat transmitted by the tape to maintain a setpoint temperature.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">A challenge I ran into was evenly distributing the temperature throughout the space as heat tended to build up at the ends of the oven. To solve this, I added a relief duct with a fan to allow for air circulation while still containing heat in the space so energy would not be wasted by venting out excess heat.</p>

                      <p class="car-text">I'd like to thank Dr. Wei Zhang for providing me this great learning opportunity at PEG!</p>
