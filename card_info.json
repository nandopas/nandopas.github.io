            design of the cooling system, and machining of all components.",
            "I learned a great amount about designing components to strike a balance between performance 
            (material weight vs load bearing capabilities), machinability, and reducing waste of material 
            during machining processes.",
            "Additionally, I had to consider fitting the drivetrain of an electric 
            vehicle into a chassis primarily designed for an internal combustion engine, all while communicating 
            with other team members to gain an idea of my design limitations in conjunction with their contributions",
