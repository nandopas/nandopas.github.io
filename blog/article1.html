	    		<h4>Why learning CSS is important before using Bootstrap</h4>
	    	</div>
	    	<small>May 5th, 2020</small>

	    	
	    		<hr>

	    	<p>
	    		Let me begin and say the irony of all of this is this site uses Bootstrap, but for a reason.
	    	</p>

	    	<p>
	    		So I used to think Bootstrap was fantastic when I first started learning how to make webpages, but I ran into a lot of troubles and headaches becuase I did not know CSS. Here's why you should learn CSS first.
	    	</p>

	    	<p>
	    		Take the old state of one of my projects, Subbit vs another project, SpotVote.
	    	</p>

	    	<div class="row">
	    		<div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-4">
	    			<img src="../images/subbit.png" alt="subbit image circa April 2019">
	    		</div>
	    		<div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-4">
	    			<img src="../images/Spotvote.PNG" alt="spotvote image circa April 2019">
	    		</div>
	    	</div>


	    	<p>
	    		Subbit looks ok there, but it's lacking a bit in the design department. In my opinion SpotVote looks a lot cleaner (not perfect, but better). That design for Subbit was done with Bootstrap before I properly knew how to use CSS. It looks like it's from the 2000s still. Also it doesn't look great on mobile because I didn't know about responsive design, some subtleties in styling, and just did not know how to fully customize Bootstrap due to my lack of knowledge.
	    	<p>

	    	<p>
	    		Here are both sites on iPhone 5 (about the smallest screen size). Notice how stuff on Subbit gets out of sync and becomes too small to read or properly interact with while SpotVote resizes elements and reduces the amount of content displayed plus has a mobile optimized navbar.
	    	</p>

	    	<div class="row">
	    		<div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-4">
	    			<img src="../images/subbitmobile.PNG" alt="subbit mobile image circa April 2019">
	    		</div>
	    		<div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-4">
	    			<img src="../images/Spotvotemobile.PNG" alt="spotvote mobile image circa April 2019">
	    		</div>
	    	</div>

	    	

	    	<p>
	    		After taking some time to learn CSS properly, I was able to make SpotVote with my own CSS and am currently giving Subbit a redesign with React and Bootstrap (properly used). Heres an example of how Subbit is looking now (still working on the React side of things). I think it looks a lot cleaner and is responsive to a page resize now.

	    	<h5 style="text-align: center">
	    		Background/Inspiring Story Time!!
	    	</h5>

	    	<p>
	    		I started off about 4 years ago trying to get this page set up when I was first learning some web development, but I completely underestimated the whole point of learning CSS and thought I could just get away with because CSS wasn't a 'real language'. And I was completely wrong. Nothing was looking the way I wanted to and just blew it off thinking it wasn't meant to be and I should focus on learning  'real languages' like Python or Java.
	    	</p>

	    	<p>
	    		Fast forward to October 2019 and I wanted to get serious about learning web development which is around when I had the idea to create <a href="https://www.subbit.net">Subbit</a>. I had also given up on Ruby on Rails about 4 years ago as well because I couldn't wrap my head around so many new topics I had never seen like MVC, REST, databases. But this time, I was determined to get it done.
	    	</p>

	    	<p>
	    		I slogged through the RoR tutorial about 10 ten times to really wrap my head around a lot of the concepts. Through those ten times, I somehow failed to get it working even though the directions should have been foolproof, I just had a fundamental gap in programming knowledge, so I didn't really know what was going on behind all the 'rails magic'. This is probably for a different write up, but long story short, I really read through the documentation to figure out what was going on behind each command and line of code
	    	</p>

	    	<p>
	    		Finally, at some point I had worked through the tutorial and gotten the functionality of Subbit more or less set up. But I wanted to make it look better than the automatic newspaper-looking style generously given to me by plain HTML. I had to face my fear of using CSS. I didn't want to waste my time with a fake programming language when I could be doing so many other cooler things.
	    	</p>

	    	<h5 style="text-align: center">
	    		In came Bootstrap
	    	</h5>

	    	<p>
	    		I was saved! I didn't have to bother learning pesky CSS (or so I thought). I could just smack some containers on the page, add a jumbotron for 'effect', and completely ignore any documentation because Bootstrap was the ultimate solution!
	    	</p>

	    	<h5 style="text-align: center">
	    		Nando: 1, CSS: 0
	    	</h5>

	    	<p>
	    		However, a lot of problems came when I wanted to customize Subbit. I would change the color of Bootstrap's navbar, and everything broke. Links didnt align, text would disappear. I accidententally rendered containers within containers in some of my partials in Rails, so a page would come up and posts had this crazy scaling down effect (which actually looked kind of cool in retrospect). So I was at loss.
	    	</p>

	    	<h5 style="text-align: center">
	    		Nando: 1, CSS: 20
	    	</h5>

	    	<p>
	    		Finally, I decided to actually learn the documentation behind Bootstrap. Lo and behold, you have to understand CSS to get the full use of Bootstrap. Time to face my fears.
	    	</p>

	    	<p>
	    		After learning CSS better, I managed to clean up Subbit. But the HTML was getting clunky with bootstrap classes and grid items. Also there were still some aspects I needed to learn to truly make it better such as responsive design. I had more learning left.
	    	</p>

	    	<h5 style="text-align: center">
	    		How to learn CSS (or really anything else)
	    	</h5>

	    	<p>
	    		So just like getting good at anything else, you have to practice the fundamentals. In the same way I slogged through Rails tutorials and made a bunch of dummy apps, I slogged through CSS and made a bunch of dummy components. You want to learn guitar and be good? Practice your scales before riffing stairway to heaven at Guitar Center. You want to ride a skateboard through NYC without falling over a pebble and almost getting hit by a car (oops)? Go find an empty street and get comfortable riding.
	    	</p>

	    	<h5 style="text-align: center">
	    		Want to get good at CSS and learn how to make a decent webpage? Practice fundamentals.
	    	</h5>

	    	<p>
	    		So I made a bunch of small webpages to practice certain parts of CSS and learned how to build mock-ups of Bootstrap components. How do I make a card have a cool shadow effect? Add some shadow boxes or shadow outlines. Why do Bootstrap buttons have smooth transitions when you hover over them? Learn CSS hover effects and how to add transitions and changes to styles. How does the grid system work? Learn basic CSS layouts such as flex-box and the CSS grid.
	    	</p>

	    	<p>
	    		One of my biggest headaches learning CSS was making navbars. I did one thing, the list items would align, but they would get stuck some where below the navbar. How did this happen? I had no idea, so I built about 100 navbars and added CSS styles step by step to see what things like the flex property did, or what the inline-block property did.
	    	</p>

	    	<p>
	    		Once I felt comfortable learning CSS, I wanted to create a webpage without any Bootstrap at all. And that's what I did with SpotVote.Now that I was comfortable with CSS, I was able to completely customize a page to look how I wanted without being restricted to a framework, which made me much happier with the result and I personally know what has to be changed in the stylesheet if I want a shadow to be less instrusive, or a transition to be smoother.
	    	</p>

	    	<p>
	    		On top of that, I now know how to better utilize Bootstrap if I want to make something quick. In short, Bootstrap has it's place, but I think there's more value in creating something yourself and using elements of CSS libraries such as Bootstrap or Material Design rather than completely relying on it.
	    	</p>
